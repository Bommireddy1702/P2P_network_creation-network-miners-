## CS 216: Introduction to Blockchain
### Assignment 2

## Team Information
- *Team Name: Network Miner's
- *Team Members:*
  - Bommireddy Varun Kumar Reddy(mc230041006)
  - Alam Sai Chathura(ce230004004)
  - kota Sanjay Kumar(cse230001042)

## Project Description
The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Chat Application is a decentralized communication system that allows multiple users to engage in real-time messaging without relying on a central server. This application is designed to facilitate simultaneous message sending and receiving through multi-threading, ensuring smooth and efficient communication.

Key Functionalities:
ðŸ”¹ Multi-Peer Support â€“ Enables multiple nodes to connect and interact within the network.
ðŸ”¹ Peer Discovery & Tracking â€“ Maintains an active list of connected peers.
ðŸ”¹ Alphabetical Peer Sorting â€“ Organizes peer names in a sorted order for faster searching and querying.
ðŸ”¹ Custom Message Format â€“ Ensures structured communication using the format:.


## Features
- *Simultaneous Send & Receive* (Multi-threading)
- *Peer Discovery & Tracking*
- *Custom Message Format:* <IP_ADDRESS:PORT> <TEAM_NAME> <MESSAGE>
- *Bonus: Persistent Peer Connection (connect() function)*

## Prerequisites
- Install dependencies:
  sudo apt update  
sudo apt install g++  
g++ --version  
g++ -o my_program my_program.cpp  
./my_program  

## How to Run
run in C++ with c++11 or c++17,


## Usage
Upon starting, the following menu is displayed:

Enter your name: Netwirk Miner's
Enter your port number: 45321
Ip address :127.0.0.1
Server listening on port 45600 & 45700

***** Menu *****
1. Send message
2. Query active peers
3. Connect to active peers
0. Quit


### Sending Messages
1. Select 1 from the menu.
2. Enter the recipient's IP & port.
3. Type your message & press Enter.

### Querying Peers
1. Select 2 from the menu.
2. List of active peers is displayed.
3.Arranging them in sorted order so that the node can check them easily 

### Exiting
- Enter 0 to quit.
- Sending exit removes a peer from the list.

## Message Format

<IP_ADDRESS:PORT> <TEAM_NAME> <MESSAGE>

Example:

10.206.4.201:8080 blockchain Hello, you there?


## Bonus Feature: connect()
- Establishes persistent peer connections.
- Newly connected peers appear in the query list.

## Notes
- Use *fixed ports* instead of ephemeral ports.
- Avoid duplicate (IP:PORT) entries.
